Requires: Python 3.6 with libraries Flask and Waitress installed.

**Endpoints**

| Endpoint | What is it for? | Requires Login |
|---|---|---|
| \/manage\/ | Lists the currently hosted studies and a menu of options  | Yes |
| \/manage\/new\/ | Lets you create a new study. Study name should be unique and contain no special characters. | Yes |
| \/manage\/\<study\>\/ | Options for editing and deleting a specific study | Yes |
| \/manage\/\<study\>\/delete\/ | Options for deleting a study and its collected data | Yes |

**Creating and editing studies**

When creating or uploading a new version of a study, select the *html folder* generated by PsychoPy via *Export Html*.

If you get a *missing resource error*, make sure that the *html folder* contains a folder called *resources*, and that this
folder contains all the resources you use in your PsychoPy study.

**Running studies**

When you first create a study, it will show up as *inactive* and will not accept subjects. You can activate it on the manage page for the specific study. Active studies can be deactivated on this same page.

If the server is set to deny unauthorized access to studies, you can give a subject access to one session of a study by
generating an *invite code* from the study's manage page. The option will give you a URL with the code already entered, which
you can then send to the subject.

NOTE: Deactivating a study will revoke all of its current invite codes.
